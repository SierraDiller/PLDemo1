            "I reached out for coaching about 2 years ago as I was preparing for a powerlifting meet. I have made significant gains in the gym and all my numbers have gone up. I would recommend Jacob to anyone. Jacob is very careful to listen to anything you need and willing to help not only in the gym but also in life. Jacob makes sure to ask the right question in order to program something we are both happy with. If there is something I do not want to do Jacob will change it for me and find a good substitute that also works. I feel very comfortable about asking Jacob anything and if I ever have any lifting concerns/injuries/events come up Jacob is sure to work with me on those things so I can still achieve my goals. I have been very pleased during these last 2 years and I look forward to continue to grow working with Jacob!"

          <p>I was born in Canton, GA and have been powerlifting for 7 years. I went to Georgia Tech for years to get my Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering and was a part of GT Barbell, where I went to CNats 3 times. I started coaching people starting Freshman year of college and have slowly built it since then, even coaching several people to qualify and go to CNats.</p>
          <p>I love watching myself and others grow. Although seeing the outcome of all the work is very rewarding, to me the process is the best part, along with the all the ups and downs associated. Life is all about giving your full self, so I see coaching as an extension of that, as well as other things in my life such as drumming and my career. Coaching and powerlifting is something that sets my heart on fire and gets me up every day, and I hope that I convey that energy to the people I coach and train.</p>
          <p>I've always lived in Georgia and spend considerable time exploring the communities and people contained within it. Becoming a part of the powerlifting community and Atlanta music scene has made me appreciate the variety of backgrounds and experiences people bring to the table. Meeting new people makes me want to ask more questions and genuinely get to know more about them by breaking the surface level. I am a firm believer that the quality of your life experience is directly related to the quality of questions you ask, so to me the more experience I have with asking questions, the better I expect the outcome to be.</p>
